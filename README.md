# Trivia

## Introduction

This is an gamified full-fledged quiz application that displays questions by category and diffiulty rating.

It requires the user to answer correctly from the displayed randomized questions which a response is given to show a succes or a failure to the question and as well the score at the end of the game.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development Setup

As a developer cloning this project, you should already have Python3, pip and node installed on your local machine.

### Cloning
To clone, simply, cd to your preferred location and

```
git clone https://github.com/okekechimezieglory/_trivia.git
```

### Backend

All required packages are included in the requirements file, to install the dependecies;

```
cd backend/
pip install requirements.txt
```

goto models.py and change database user and password to yours, mine is `postgres` and `chimex`


To run the development server:

```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --reload
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made.

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

### Frontend

From the root folder, run the following commands to start the client:

```
cd frontend/
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.

### Tests

In order to run tests navigate from the root folder and run the following commands:

```
cd backend/
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

## API Reference

### Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

```
{
    "success": False,
